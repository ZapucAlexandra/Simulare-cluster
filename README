   node.py
--------------

	In the constructor of the class node, a function is called to create and
start 16 threads per node.
	Because the data is partitioned and a node must communicate with other
nodes if it needs data, a buffer of data is used for gather operations
so that in one round every node can read from another node's buffer data
and do the computations it has to do.
	The tasks that are received by a node are stored in a sinchronized
queue. A thread takes a task from queue(if there is one) or blocks until
a task is added.
	When there are no tasks in queue to be processed, each node has to wait
until the others have finished their tasks and after that buffer data is 
updated with the results of the scatter operations.


  threads.py
--------------

	Each thread tries to get a task. If there is no task in the nodes's queue
the current thread waits until a task is available.
	For each tuple in in_slices, the thread gathers the data from another
node and extends result list with the one he obtained.
	After the computations made on result list, the threads starts to scatter
the data. A thread ca scatter the result because a buffer of the initial data
is used if another thread wants to gather data.


 barrier.py
-------------

	This barrier is used to sinchronize the nodes.
